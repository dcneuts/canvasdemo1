Treehouse jQuery exercise integrating canvas features in HTML5

Demo as part of a Treehouse exercise within the jQuery subcourse in Front-End Development.
Constructed initially using Atom with in-editor preview, then moved to WebStorm for debugging.

Still needs some minor debugging and cross-browser testing, but a very intriguing student project
involving user interactivity.  As a student programmer, I'm feeling much more comfortable now
with jQuery, its syntax, functions, and integration.
